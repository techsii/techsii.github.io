                <h3 class="article-title">7. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h3>
                <p class="article-text article-content visible">MitM attacks intercept and alter communication between two parties, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or manipulate data transmission.</p>
                <p class="article-text article-content"> These attacks can occur on unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi hotspots, where attackers can intercept sensitive information transmitted between devices. Combat MitM attacks by using encrypted communication channels, such as HTTPS or VPNs, to protect data in transit. Additionally, organizations should implement certificate validation mechanisms to verify the authenticity of websites and regularly monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious activity indicative of a MitM attack.</p>
